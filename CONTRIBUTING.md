We welcome contributions from developers, especially bugfixes, uplifts to dependencies, code quality, etc. New features are also welcome but please raise an issue first on GitHub to discuss whether it's right for the project. Feature requests should ideally be driven by an actual real-world use case, rather than "it would be cool if&hellip;".

# Setting up for development
 * Make sure you have the latest NodeJS/npm installed, and git
 * Fork or Clone the repository (`git clone https://github.com/atropos-tech/react-curry-component.git`)
 * Install all dependencies (`npm install`)

# Testing
When developing, use `npm test` to run tests with watching.

We try to keep coverage high, but 100% is not necessary. All features/bugfix should have associated tests, but writing tests just to get 100% coverage if it doesn't cover a meaningful case is discouraged.
